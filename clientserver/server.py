Server Application
The server will:

Receive input in the form of a string, consisting solely of digits. If the
received string contains any non-digit character, the server will return an
error code to the client and terminate. Perform a digit sum on the number. Send
the digit sum result to the client. Terminate if the input is a single digit
long.
